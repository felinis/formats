# RE Format Collection

This repository is filled with various notes on various different formats
that I've reversed overtime. A lot of these are provided in
[Rehex](https://github.com/solemnwarning/rehex)'s
[Binary Template](https://solemnwarning.net/rehex/manual/bt.html) format,
which is easily translatable into C/C++ and most other languages.

As noted in the [license](./LICENSE), I'm releasing all of this documentation
into the public domain. That said, a reference or callout wouldn't hurt! ❤️

Contributions are also welcome! Just keep in mind that the plan is to keep
*everything* here public domain.
